<title>Rob's notes-to-self about the ELF file format.</title>

<p>The actual spec is available <a href=http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/ELF.txt>here</a>,
these are just my notes from reading it:</p>

<p>There are three kinds of ELF files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Executables</li>
<li>Shared libraries (*.so)</li>
<li>Relocatable files (*.o)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Elf Header</h2>

<p>Each ELF file starts with an <b>elf header</b>, which (for 32 bit elfses)
looks like:</p>

<pre>
struct liv_tyler {
  uint8_t ident[4];   // Always set to "0x7fELF"
  uint8_t class;      // 1==32 bit, 2==64 bit
  uint8_t endian;     // 1==little endian, 2==big endian
  uint8_t version1;   // Set to 1
  uint8_t pad[9];     // Unused (set to 0)
  uint16_t type;      // 1==relocatable.o, 2==executable, 3==sharedobject.so
  uint16_t machine;   // 2==sparc,3==x86,4==m68k,10==mips
  uint32_t version2;  // Set to 1
  uint32_t entry;     // Process entry point (virtual address)
  uint32_t phoff;     // Program Header table (file offset, usually ehsize or 0)
  uint32_t shoff;     // Section header table (file offset)
  uint32_t flags;     // "processor-specific flags", whatever that is.
  uint16_t ehsize;    // Set to 52 (elf header's size in bytes.  Why?)
  uint16_t phentsize; // sizeof(program header table entry) == 32
  uint16_t phnum;     // Count of entries in program header table (0 for *.o).
  uint16_t shentsize; // sizeof(section header table entry) == 40
  uint16_t shnum;     // Count of entries in section header table.
  uint16_t shstrndx;  // Index in section header table of .shstrtab
} eheader;
</pre>

<p>The "endian" byte indicates the endianness of the rest of the data.  The
default entry value for x86 is 0x8048000.</p>

<p>The above refers to three other data structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>program header table</b> - used to load program into memory and execute it.</li>
<li>The <b>section header table</b> - used by compiler, linker, objdump, gdb...</li>
<li>The <b>section header string table</b> - we'll get to this later.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Program Header Table</h2>

<p>Executables and shared libraries have a program header table, *.o files do
not (which is why you can't run 'em).  When an ELF file has a program header
table, it usually starts right after the ELF header, I.E. eheader.phoff == 52.
For *.o files both phoff and phnum are zero.</p>

<p>The program header table is an array of program header structs, each of which
describes a chunk of the file relevant to actually executing a program with
this file.  The ELF spec says it must come before any other loadable segment
in the file, although it doesn't say why.</p>

<p>Each of the program header structs looks like:</p>

<pre>
struct orlando_bloom {
  uint32_t type;    // LOAD=1, DYNAMIC=2, INTERP=3, NOTE=4, PHDR=6
  uint32_t offset;  // Starting location of data in file.
  uint32_t vaddr;   // virtual address to map the segment into memory at
  uint32_t paddr;   // physical address (unused in Linux?)
  uint32_t filesz;  // Number of bytes to load from file.
  uint32_t memsz;   // Number of bytes to allocate in memory.
  uint32_t flags;   // Or together: execute=1, write=2, read=4
  uint32_t align;   // loader aligns vaddr to this, must be power of 2.
} pheader;
</pre>

<p>If memsz > filesz then the memory at the end is zeroed.  (If memsz < filesz
your ELF file is broken.)  The flags say what permissions to mmap it with.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>An INTERP program header (there can be only one per file, presumably
Connor McLeod) indicates the dynamic linker, and the first thing an exec() call
does is look for one of these and if it finds it, loads that program instead and
passes it a filehandle to this one.  (Look at the uClibc dynamic linker source
to see how that works.)</p></li>

<li><p>A LOAD segment gets mapped into the program's address space.  (This is
more or less a "normal" segment.)  The loader basically does:
<blockquote>
  mmap(ph.vaddr, ph.filesz, ph.flags, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, ph.offset)
</blockquote>
Plus the bit about extra zeroed memory at the end, if any.</p></li>

<li><p>A DYNAMIC segment refers to something this program need to get out of a
shared library.  The dynamic linker needs to fix these up before the program
can run, which means static executables can't have any DYNAMIC
segments.</p></li>

<li><p>A NOTE section is a comment.  Don't bother.  Humans seldom read ELF
files by hand.</p></li>

<li><p>A PHDR section points back to the program header itself, showing where
it lives in the file.  This makes life easier for debuggers, but is not
actually required.</p>

<h2>Section Headers:</h2>

<p>The section header table is an array of these structures:</p>
<pre>
struct cate_blanchett {
  uint32_t name;  // Name of section (index into section header string table)
  uint32_t type;  // Type of this section (see below)
  uint32_t flags; // Or together: 1 writeable, 2 occupies memory, 4 executable
  uint32_t addr;  // Virtual address at which to map this section (0 if none)
  uint32_t offset;// Start of section in file.
  uint32_t size;  // Section's length in bytes
  uint32_t link;  // varies based on type (usually section header index of
                     a related string or symbol table)
  uint32_t info;  // varies based on type
  uint32_t addralign; // Alignment (must be power of 2)
  uint32_t entsize;   // Size of entries (or 0)
}
</pre>

<p>The "type" field can be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 = <b>PROGBITS</b> - binary data, just map it in.</li>
<li>2 = <b>SYMTAB</b> - Imports symbol table (what we need to run).</li>
<li>3 = <b>STRTAB</b> - String table</li>
<li>4 = <b>RELA</b> - Relocation entries "with explicit addends"</li>
<li>5 = <b>HASH</b> - Symbol hash table (for dynamic linking)</li>
<li>6 = <b>DYNAMIC</b> - Exports symbol table (we are a shared library)</li>
<li>7 = <b>NOTE</b> - Comment</li>
<li>8 = <b>NOBITS</b> - zeroed data (bss)</li>
<li>9 = <b>REL</b> - Relocation entries "without explicit addends".  (What's an addend?)</li>
<li>11 = <b>DYNSYM</b> - Brief version of SYMTAB (just the symbols the linker
actually needs.)</li>
</ul>

<p>A section index is an index into the array of section headers.  Special
indexes that _don't_ point into the array are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>SHN_UNDEF</b> (0) - Undefined symbol</li>
<li><b>SHN_ABS</b> (0xfff1) - Symbols living at an absolute address.</li>
<li><b>SHN_COMMON</b> (0xfff2) - "common" symbols (Unallocated globals?  What?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the first section header (0, also known as SHN_UNDEF) exists but
can never be used and has all zeroed fields.  It's wasted space.  Bad spec
developers, no biscuit!  (I wonder if anything actually _refers_ to it, and if
not can I just cheat and omit it?  Not that tinycc really optimizes the size of
the output binaries but come on guys, this is sad and pointless.  Maybe exec
or ld-linux.so uses it internally?)</p>

<h2>String Table</h2>
</p>A STRTAB is a bunch of null terminated strings one after the other, the
first of which is zero length (always starts with a NULL byte at position 0).
The last string must be null terminated, can't end the section short.  (As a
special case, a zero length STRTAB is allowed, and referring to offset zero in
it refers to an empty string.)</p>

<p>The "shstridx" field in the elf header is the index of a section header with
a STRTAB for the section names.  The "name" field in each section header is
an index into that string table.</p>

<h2>Symbol Table</h2>

<p>The symbol table is another array.  Executables don't actually need it
(unless they contain debugging information), but object files and shared
libraries do.</p>

<p>The structure for symbol tables is:</p>

<pre>
typedef hugo_weaving {
  uint32_t name;  // Index into the object string table (in sht.link), 0=none
  uint32_t value; // Value of the symbol
  uint32_t size;  // Size of symbol (0 for none or unknown)
  uint8_t  info;  // High 4 bits symbol binding: 0=local, 1=global, 2=weak
                  // Low 4 bits symbol type: data=1, func=2, section=3, file=4
  uint8_t  other; // Set to 0
  uint16_t shndx; // Section header table index for this symbol's section.
};
</pre>

<p>And again, the spec insists that the first entry in each symbol table be
wasted and zeroed out.</p>

</pre>
