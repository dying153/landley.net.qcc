<title>Rob's TCC fork</title>

<h2><b>News</b></h2>
<h2><b>October 27, 2007</b></h2>
<p>De-abandoned project.  Ok, I've been working on this darn unofficial fork
on and off for a year, and it's time to decide if I'm doing it or not.  I'm
doing it.</p>

<p>I'm making my fork (tinycc) a separate project from the original (tcc).
I'm taking advantage of LGPL clause 3 to change the license of tinycc
to GPL version 2.  I'm poking around in mailman trying to set up a list for
the new project.</p>

<p>My goal is to get this thing to build everything Firmware Linux needs.
That means it should build the Linux kernel, uClibc, and busybox/toybox.
And, of course, itself.</p>

<p>There's still a _lot_ of work left to be done, but that's just a matter of
doing it.</p>

<p>Abandoned project.  (See <a href=/notes-2007.html#04-10-2007>blog</a>.)</p>

<h2><b>August 18, 2007</b></h2>
<p>Started work on a <a href=differences.html>list of
differences between tcc and gcc</a>.  It's about time to start thinking of
another release...</p>

<h2><b>May 10, 2007</b></h2>
<p>Added a <a href=bugs>bugs directory</a> containing little
C files that each demonstrate an unfixed bug in tcc.</p>

<h2><b>April 29, 2007</b></h2>
<p>Ok, I put out <a href=downloads>a release</a>.  It works
for me.  It's <a href=http://landley.net/hg/tinycc?cl=431>mercurial
changeset 431</a>.</p>

<h2><b>About</b></h2>

<p>This is a rampantly unofficial fork of <a href=http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc>Fabrice Bellard's Tiny C Compiler</a>.
These days Fabrice's attention is taken up by <a href=http://qemu.org>QEMU</a>,
and the original TCC project is stalled.</a>

<p><a href=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tinycc-devel/2006-09/msg00024.html>Fabrice put out a request for a new maintainer in 2006</a>, but
he insisted that the project continue using the obsolete CVS repository format,
and stay hosted on Savannah.  This didn't interest me, but tcc itself does,
my <a href=/hg/tinycc>mercurial repository</a> is public, and I take patches.</p>

<p>What discussion there is still takes place on
<a href=http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/tinycc-devel>the old tcc
list</a>.  In addition, I hang out on #firmware on freenode, and my bouts of
fiddling with tcc are documented in <a href=/notes.html>my development
blog</a>.</p>

<p>Someday, I'd like to get <a href=/code/firmware>Firmware Linux</a>
down to just four packages: linux, uClibc, toybox, and tinycc.  This means
tinycc has to be able to build the other three, and there's work to be done
there...</p>
