I'd like to to release qcc under 2-clause BSD.  Fabrice Bellard said he's
ok with this:

Fabrice changed the license to GPL in commits 268 and 270, so anything before
that would be commits Fabrice retained the right to relicense (and thus I
have permission for via the above statment). The external contributions before
then were:

  223, 227: Peter Lund
  250, 258, 259: Dave Long

Here are the third party commits between the LGPL relicensing and my
repository forking off from the tinycc CVS:

tcc:
  281, 282: mauro persano
  285: romain francoise
  295, 306, 307: Daniel Glockner
  305, 308, 309: TK
  348: Jon Griffiths
  352: Bernhard Fischer
  354, 364, 366, 368, 370, 372, 377: Grischka
  384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389: Filip Navara
  394: Tao Wu

So I need to:

 A) read through all that and see what they were
 B) Either contact people to get permission to BSD their code, or remove that
    code.
 C) Go through my tree since then and see what third party code I included.
